# Data Directory

## Structure
- `raw/`: Raw FHIR R4 (JSON) patient data from partner institutions — tracked by DVC, stored in S3
- `processed/`: Cleaned and validated data after ingestion pipeline — tracked by DVC
- `features/`: Engineered features ready for ML model training — tracked by DVC

## Partner Institutions
| Institution | ID | Location | Synthetic Patient Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| German Cancer Research Center | dkfz | Heidelberg | 500 |
| University Hospital Heidelberg | ukhd | Heidelberg | 700 |
| European Molecular Biology Laboratory | embl | Heidelberg | 300 |

## Data Format
- **Raw**: FHIR R4 JSON resources (Patient, Encounter, Condition, MedicationRequest)
- **Processed**: Validated CSV with standardized columns
- **Features**: CSV with columns: age, num_conditions, num_medications, recent_encounters, gender_encoded, readmitted

## Privacy
All data is synthetic (generated by Synthea) — no real patient information is stored in this repository.
Real data is encrypted at rest in S3 (AES-256) and never committed to git.

## DVC Usage

# Pull data from S3
dvc pull

# Push new data to S3
